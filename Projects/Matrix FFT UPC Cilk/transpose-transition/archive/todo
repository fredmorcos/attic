upc matrix transpose
    single element access
    	   upc-forall (BS=1, BS=N/NT)
	   for	      (BS=1, BS=N/NT)
    bulk access
           memget/put (sync/async)
		single line
		multiple lines (ilist)
    tiling/mutli-dimensional "blocking"
    processor assignment
    collective communication

	rectangular matrixes
	even and odd sizes of N, M and NT
	combinations of BS

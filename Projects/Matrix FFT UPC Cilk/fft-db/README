This is a 2D implementation of David Baley's FFT using parallel 1D
FFTs on matrix rows and a cache-oblivious parallel matrix
transposition using Cilk.

TODO:

1. Currently only the "Four Step" FFT is implemented. Extensions of
this algorithm as well as more advanced ones can be implemented too.

2. The transposition can be replaced with Martin Polak's
implementation using UPC and Cilk.

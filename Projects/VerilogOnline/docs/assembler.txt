This file describes how the assembler command line interface should be
to work properly with the mgen script.

There are two cases for a machine, and for each case, there are two
cases for the assembler.

Configuration of cases follows what's in the machine's definition file
[1]. Namely the "assembler", "debug_info" and "single_mem" settings.

The assembler binary should be found in bin/assemblers, a symlink to
the original source/build dir is a good solution.

ASMBIN	    assembler's binary filename given in the "assembler"
	    setting in [1].
ASMFILE	    the input filename (the user's assembly program file).
PROG	    assembler's program output file.
DATA	    assembler's data output file.
DPROG	    assembler's debug program output file.
DDATA	    assembler's debug data output file.

Cases:

1. MACHINE IS SINGLE MEMORY
   a. ASSEMBLER SUPPORTS DEBUG OUTPUT
      command: ASMBIN ASMFILE PROG LPROG

   b. ASSEMBLER DOESN'T SUPPORT DEBUG OUTPUT
      command: ASMBIN ASMFILE PROG

2. MACHINE IS DUAL MEMORY
   a. ASSEMBLER SUPPORTS DEBUG OUTPUT
      command: ASMBIN ASMFILE PROG DATA LPROG LDATA

   b. ASSEMBLER DOESN'T SUPPORT DEBUG OUTPUT
      command: ASMBIN ASMFILE PROG DATA

The mgen script expects the assembler to follow this convention for
the command line arguments and expects the assembler to output to the
respective (given) files.

If an assembler is not given in the definition file, the machine is
assumed to accept program and data file(s) with extensions .p and .d
for program and data respectively in case of double memory and .p only
in case of single memory. Debug data is not treated.

As explained in [2], the command line argument to the mgen script is
--program PROGRAM.s in case of an existing assembler, --program
PROGRAM.p in case of single memory and --program PROGRAM.p,DATA.d in
case of double memory.

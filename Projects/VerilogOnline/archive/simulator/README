This directory contains all projects, testbeds, trials and prototypes
for the Computer Architecture Simulator.

archive/ contains older versionso of the project with some very early
trials.

cas-v0-18042011/ contains the earliest working "milestone" for the
project.

cas-v1/ contains the second working "milestone" with better
client-side drawing of machines, a desktop version of the client-side
viewer and a fig+machine_definition "compiler".

cas-v2/ contains the work-in-progress for a better fig parser, better
client-side machine drawing and a veriwell dump file parser. This is
still in the works and the goal is to make defining machines
(including the verilog code) much simpler.

fig-ref/ contains the fig format (version 3.2) documentation, a
complete fig parser (from cas-v2) and a "translator" for the Rapahel
client-side javascript drawing library (used in cas-v2).

machine-web* directories contain code for rendering machines on
client-side web browsers.

web-tests contains some fig files and code to render machines on web
browsers, used for testing special cases as well as fig parsing.

web-trials contains code for trials with web browser drawing
libraries.

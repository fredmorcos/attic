This is the Computer Architecture Simulator project directory. This is
a "version 2" attempt which should provide a simpler way for:

1. Better parsing of fig files [DONE]
2. Simpler definition of machines [DONE]
3. Veriwell dumpfile parsing
4. Output to different "formats" [DONE-PARTIAL]
   a) For several client-side javascript drawing/UI libraries
   b) For a "desktop version" of the simulator

docs/

Contains documentation files and diagrams showing the different
processes (taken from "version 1").

ref/

Most relevant/needed pieces of code from "version 1" for reference.

sbn/

The SBN machine definition files, fig file and Verilog file.

tests/

SBN assembly programs for testing.

cac.py

The "Computer Architecture Compiler" which merges the machine datapath
description file (in .json format) with the generated json image (from
the datapath fig file, using fig2json.py - see below) and the verilog
code corresponding to that machine datapath.

cas.py

The "Computer Architecture Simulator" which basically takes care of
running and parsing simulation data. Takes a machine filename
(generated with cac.py), a program file, a data file and some more
parameters which can be viewed with ./cas.py --help and outputs a
machine datapath "state" in json format.

fig2json.py

This translates a fig image to a JSON representation.

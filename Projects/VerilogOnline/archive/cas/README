cac.py

The "Computer Architecture Compiler" which merges the machine datapath
description file (in .json format) with the generated json image (from
the datapath fig file) and the verilog code corresponding to that
machine datapath.

cas.py

The "Computer Architecture Simulator" which basically takes care of
running and parsing simulation data. Takes a machine filename
(generated with cac.py), a program file, a data file and some more
parameters which can be viewed with ./cas.py --help and outputs a
machine datapath "state" in json format.

Makefile

A GNU make "makefile" used to build "sub-projects" like machine
description files and install them into appropriate paths.

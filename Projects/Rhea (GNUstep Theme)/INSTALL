Installation
------------

Just compile the Rhea bundle : 

	make

You should have now a Rhea.themeEngine bundle. 
Copy this bundle where you want.

After that, you also need to tell GNUstep where to find the 
theme bundle, so write : 

	defaults write NSGlobalDomain  GSAppKitUserBundles '( "YourLocationTo/Rhea.themeEngine" )'

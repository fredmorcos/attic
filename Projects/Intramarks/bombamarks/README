Development
===========

You will need NodeJS (and NPM) installed. There are two supported ways
to deploy the project for development purposes:

1) Having node_modules in a system directory like
/usr/lib/node_modules, in this case you need to install Express
globally as follows:

sudo npm install -g express

Then, cd into the project directory and install the project
dependencies (local node_modules) in the project directory by running:

npm install

2) Having node_modules in a non-standard directory like
~/projects/node_modules, in this case you need to:

a. install all local project dependencies from package.json
b. edit projectrc and set PROJECT_LIBS to ~/projects
c. source projectrc

as follows:

cd ~/projects/
npm install -l express jade  # and others
cd ~/projects/intramarks
# edit projectrc as in step b.
source projectrc

Afterwards, you only need to source projectrc.

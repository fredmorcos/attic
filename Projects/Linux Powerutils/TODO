* Add state saving/loading in /var/tmp, This way we can show what is
  enabled/disabled and show some status (ie, webcam and bluetooth
  kernel modules come to mind)

* Add enable/disable vs. low_power/dynamic/high_perf parameters

* Add [low|high]_power_[startup|shutdown] or states for
  booting/shutting down to avoid corner case issues on some hardware
  (quirk files?)

* Add hibernate/sleep and ac/battery states too?

* Fix USB Human Interface Devices (HIDs) from sleeping (or increase
  sleep timeout dramatically)

server:
	**server_constructor:
		if a hacker connects to the server and doesn't
		send a nickname immediately, the server object
		will hang (waiting for the nickname) at line:
			String temp_client_name = readers_list.getLast().readLine().trim();
		
		this can be overpassed by creating a linkedlist
		of Socket server_socket so each connecting client
		can take his time to send the nickname.
		
		this is fixed in the chatter's client, but of
		course a hacker will not use the usual client :D

  \section{Goal}
  \label{sec:goal}
  
  The goal of this project is to implement a parser in the Monad category that carries the following set of features
  
  \begin{itemize}
  
	\item Easily composable using Haskell's \texttt{do}-notation
	
	\item General enough to allow arbitrary combinations of sub-parsers
	
	\item Have a single function as its engine, partially applied should yield all the flexible building blocks
	
	\item Have as many building blocks as is reasonable, implemented as sub-parsers (e.g. Int, Double)
	
	\item Efficient parsing, with a look-ahead of 1
	
	\item Accurate error reports, in terms of lines and columns
	
	\item On the fly construction of the target structures, rather than an intermediate parse tree
	
  \end{itemize}
  
  The main test-bed for the parser is the Personal Expense Tracker (PET) file format. A format that is simple and as concise as is reasonable.

RATIONALE

The main goal behind the PET file format is to keep it as compact as possible
while still human manageable through a text editor. Not that you should need to
edit it manually, but just in case you hit a bug or the PET tool misbehaves. It
might also be useful if you only have access to the file on a machine without
PET installed.

The PET file format is text- and line- based. This means that each line contains
a new construct.

The format has notions for the following:

* Date of expense.
* Amount of expense.
* Person that carried expense [Optional].
* Shop where expense was carried [Optional].
* Tags related to the expense [One or more].
* Note about the expense [Optional].

HEADER AND INDEXES

The header consists of a set of indexes. Indexes are a mapping from an Unsigned
Integer to a String.

So far, there are two indexes: on the first line is the index for Persons and on
the second line is the index for Shops.

An Index is defined on a single line of text, index elements

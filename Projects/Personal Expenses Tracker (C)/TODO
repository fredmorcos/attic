Develop a more elaborate format:

 - Support City/Country of payment

 - Support different accounts with income and outcome to and from each
   account, this can allow for a wallet (cash) account, a running bank
   account and a savings account, then you would be able to model the
   case where you withdraw money from the running account into your
   wallet, or putting running credit into the savings account or more
   generally making any transfer from any account to any other account

 - Support a main currency along with secondary currencies, where if
   you travel to another country, the tool would take care of
   converting from the secondary currency used in that country to your
   main currency. This would require storing the currency conversion
   value of that day into the format.

 - Have an extra field which can contain arbitrary extra attributes
   (properties and their values)

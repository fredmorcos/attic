*	DocumentManager should only care about the current open document (current selected tab), 
	use a signal in the GtkNotebook when tabs are switched to switch the current document in
	the document manager.
*	Document shouldn't know anything about its filename, just its data representation.
*	Eliminate _all_ Gtk warnings.
*	Fix Document for loading and saving.

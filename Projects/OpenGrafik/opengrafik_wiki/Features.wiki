=introduction=

this page lists the decided features for OG listed by priority

*note:* priorities will change over time as more features get completed

=details=

==1st==
have a working application
 * primitive shapes and text drawing
   # lines
   # circles
   # rectangles (squares special case)
 * shape and text properties
   # position
   # color
   # size
   # edit with some dialogs and numbers
 * adding/removing shapes and text
 * connecting shapes
 * load and save to files (XML?)

==2nd==
 * support for layers
   # overlay multiple diagrams
 * drag/drop, move/resize shapes
 * export/import to/from svg/image files
   # load extra primitive shapes from image/svg files
 * stencils and complex shapes support
 * zooming
 * auto-resizing canvas

==3rd==
 * printing
 * visually animate diffs between files
   # diffs between documents
   # look at adobe photoshop records
 * semantic description and tagging of shapes and objects for disabled people
 * built-in diagrams (also being easily modified for specific usage)
 * export/import to/from dia or OG
   # implementing open format OG
 * usability
   # accessibility
   # ease of use
   # internationalization
 * help system and documentation
 * show circles over possible overlapping between shapes inside diagram (use NSSRect intersection features for this)

==additional==
 * regular expression <-> NFA or DFA generation
 * code generation from flow-charts or UML diagrams
 * document encryption and locking with password
 * portability
 * semantic description of shapes
   # semantic relations between diagrams and shapes
     # for processing (searching or filtering using information)
   # saving with semantic information
   # line or connector between shapes has a semantic meaning
   # using semantic information with UML (example)
   # make sure not to irritate the user with questions
 * supporting other open diagram formats
 * collaborative diagramming
 * svg format with connectors
 * semantically tagging and creating diagrams 
   # with wizards
 * export to formats supported by MS Powerpoint and OO impress
 * support for the MS visio format
 * snapping and smart connectors
 * command shortcuts
   # create shapes through keyboard commands (for disabled people)
 * text to speech support
 * notes
 * plug-in system 
   # plug-ins for specific usages (electrical engineering, materials, lighting, etc...)
   # shape differentiation (differences between wires and lines)
 * layouting for automatically reordering shapes (save space and ordered scene)
 * creating complex shapes (photos) from pre-defined svgs
 * mini map for large diagrams
 * web interface

==technical==
 * scalability, speed and performance
   # extensive profiling
   # clipping and lazy redrawing
   # ~~look into lower level solutions~~
   # ~~multi-threaded rendering~~
   # double/triple buffering
   # offscreen rendering for widgets
   # rendering only visible parts in files
 * debugging
 * object/state aware canvas
   # layer support
 * vector graphics support
   # zooming, scaling and svg
 * ~~cmake or autotools?~~ gnustep-make

==more==
 * user evaluation and testing

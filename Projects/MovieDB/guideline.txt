
- Download and install Tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org

- Download Eclipse 3.0 or later from www.eclipse.org

- Add the folder as an eclipse project

- Update the classpath for the project
	(Right click the project -> Properties -> java build path)
   Add external JARs jsp-api.jar and servlet-api.jar 
   to the Java Build Path
   They are in common/lib in the Tomcat installation folder

- Update the classpath for ant so that the new targets
  can be interpreted.
  Windows -> Preferences -> Ant Runtime
  Add external JARs to Ant Home Entries:
      Add ant.jar from apache-ant/lib in the JWSDP-folder
	  Add tools.jar from the lib folder inside your jdk folder

- Update the build.properties: set your Tomcat username and password

- update the build.xml-file wherever it says to do so (check "UPDATE THIS" comments inside the file)

- Running the application
  1. Run Tomcat (check that Tomcat is running by opening http:\\localhost:8080 on the web browser)
  2. Run the ant-targets compile and install
  	this can be done by double-clicking build.xml, then right-clicking "Sample" Ant under "Outline"
  	check for Ant messages on the Console
  3. Webbrowser: Open
        "http://localhost:8080/Sample"

- Updating the application
  If you want to add new Servlets, don't forget to declare this
  in the WEB-INF/web.xml

- Frustration? Try not to crush the PC. 
I almost did that the first time I tried to deploy a Java-based web application on Tomcat. 
Doesn't help. Better send me an e-mail or ask me.

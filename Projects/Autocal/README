Usage:
------

AutoCal accepts input from standard input (stdin) in a simple custom format. An
example format is in examples/ and should followed exactly (autocal doesn't try
to be as flexible as possible with the syntax).

Example:
./autocal.py < mycalendar.acf

The input file should be piped through stdin. Any errors will be output through
stderr and any output will be shown through stdout.

Command line arguments can be found using ./autocal.py --help

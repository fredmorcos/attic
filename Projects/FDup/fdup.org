* Requirements

- =fdup= finds duplicate files and directories:
  + It only deals with directories (=DT_DIR=) and regular files (=DT_REG=).
  + Hardlinks to regular files must be checked and ignored.
  + Hardlinks are detected as multiple regular files with similar inodes.
  + It must be able to create relative symlinks to duplicate files.
  + It must have a dry-run option to prevent damage to the filesystem.
  + It must be able to present the user with empty files and directories.
  + It must be interactive and as protective as possible.
  + Duplicate files are detected by size, then checksum, then byte-by-byte.
  + Duplicate dirs are detected when each file is matched.
  + Almost duplicate dirs should be detected and differences shown.
  + Ignore =.git=, =.svn= and =CVS= dirs.

* Usage

=fdup= is an interactive command-line utility and supports the following
arguments (=fdup [-hvnlde] DIRS...=):

- =-h= to show a help message.
- =-v= to show a version message.
- =-n= to enable a dry-run:
  + Disable modifications to the filesystem.
  + Disable interactivity.
- =-l= to create relative symlinks to deleted duplicates.
- =-d= to also try and find duplicate dirs.
- =-e= to also find empty files and dirs.
- =DIRS= is the list of dirs to check for duplicates.

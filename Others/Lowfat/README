an "engine" for natural document viewing for free desktop-systems

lowfat is far from done. So do not package it or something similar. It would
imply to end-users that it is a "finished product", which it is not yet... by 
far not.

So for the sake of lowfat's reputation, please do not package it yet. It's
only for developers atm.
